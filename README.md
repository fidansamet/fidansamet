### Hello world, I am Fidan :wave:

I am a senior Computer Engineering student at [Hacettepe University](https://www.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/), Ankara, Turkey. I have experience in mobile applications, computer graphics, computer vision and machine learning. I just finished [Google Get Ahead: EMEA 2020 program](https://events.withgoogle.com/get-ahead-emea-2020/) and my internship at [ASELSAN](https://www.aselsan.com.tr/). I am currently working on personal projects. I like to improve myself and learn new things. Apart from being a student and developer, I enjoy playing piano, doing yoga, traveling and playing sports.
