### Hello world, I am Fidan :wave:

I am a senior Computer Engineering student at [Hacettepe University](https://www.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/), Ankara, Turkey. I have experience in mobile applications, computer graphics, computer vision and machine learning. I specialize on and have strong interest in computer vision, deep learning and their applications.

I am currently:  
• Working on **Sketch to Sketch Translation Using Reinforcement Learning** through [DREAM: Undergraduate Research Experience Program](http://dream.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/).  
• Working on **Animation to Sketch Translation** for design project with my teammate [Oğuz Bakır](https://github.com/oguzbakir).  
• Participating in [AI Labs Joint Program](https://inzva.com/ai/2020/ai-labs-joint-program) on **Computer Vision for Autonomous Driving** organized by [inzva](https://inzva.com/) and [Koç KUIS AI Lab](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/).

I like to improve myself and learn new things. Apart from being a student and a developer, I enjoy playing piano, doing yoga, traveling and playing sports.
