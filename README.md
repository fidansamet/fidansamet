### Hello, world! I am Fidan :wave:

I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Hacettepe University Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/). I am currently working as a software engineer at [Plentific](https://www.plentific.com/) and continuing my research on *animation-to-cartoon transfer* and *musical style transfer* topics.

As a dedicated and motivated software engineer, I love exploring different fields and new technologies. I have experience in *mobile/desktop/web applications*, *computer graphics*, *computer vision*, *machine/deep learning* and *frontend/backend development*. My career goal is to leverage my experience and increase my knowledge in computer science while facing new challenges.
